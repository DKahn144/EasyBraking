Maui Sensor Management

The nuget package for managing Maui sensors shall make it easy to:

1. Specify a test sensor feed for any MAUI app.

2. Control the sensor signal feed with buffering with multiple options.

3. Log the sensor data to a file for replaying later.

The user must pass the sensor source object to his app.  The sensor source can be 
created with parameters that tell it how to behave.

These parameters are:
	1. What to take as the source: test data or real readings
	2. Whether and how to buffer the readings.
	3. Whether to write the readings out to a file.

It should also be not difficult to override this behavior with their own code.


An additional feature is that the project will provide the values for absolute acceleration relative to the earth and the direction of travel.

Because of combined sensor calculations, a data object should be available from the static class which can be
used in a way similar to the other sensor instances.  It needs a similar interface.


Configuration should use these methods:

1.  In the builder setup, sensor instances should be injectable as scoped or singletons.

2.  Code that accesses sensors should rely on:
	a  An instance of IAcceleration, IGeolocation, IOrientationSensor
	b  The source of the instance could be the static manager class provided by this project.
	c  Settings can be set initially where the injection happens, or anywhere else.


Requirements:

1.  Provide typical injection usage examples.
2.  Provide sample consumer code accessing these instances.
3.  Provide a static class interface from which any of these instances can be retrieved.
4.  Allow one sensor instance to combine the features in any way desired.
5.  Consider switches on the static class that allows features to be turned on and off, even for injected instances.
