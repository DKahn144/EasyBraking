# EasyBraking

![EASY Braking App](https://github.com/DKahn144/EasyBraking/easybrakingapp.png)

The Easy Braking mobile app displays the vehicle's braking rate or acceleration rate on the phone.

When the braking rate goes higher than a certain value, the displayed braking rate value flashes.  
The plan is to add an alarm that beeps when a set braking rate limit is exceeded.

The purpose of this app is to help drivers learn to control their braking rate.  This achieves two things:

1. It improves safe handling of the vehicle by training the driver not to brake too hard. 
2. It prepares the driver to perform well on some auto-insurance driving monitoring apps, which report the
   driver's braking habits to the insurance company for a possible good-driver discount.

So the EasyBraking app will help users to become safer drivers and save money on their auto insurance too!

At this time, only the Android version of this app is working, if built as an APK file. The Iphone version 
is planned.
